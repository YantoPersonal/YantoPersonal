# About

PhD Research Student and Hourly Paid Lecturer at the University of South Wales in partnership with TATA Steel.

Big Data Analytics are fundamental to success in modern businesses. No longer do the big devour the small in business, now the fast eat the slow. This is predominantly due to big data facilitating companies to make improved decisions at speed leading to cost reduction and increasing efficiency. This field is evolving at an outlandish pace plus businesses are under increasing pressures to sustain and improve profit. These pressures pave the way to develop new techniques in data science hence why this is such an exciting field.

In recent times, I've been the lead lecturer on a number of MSc Courses, predominantly focused on Machine Learning Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence, and will be employed as a full-time Lecturer at the University of South Wales come December 2021. In the past I have volunteered as a teaching assistant at my comprehensive school, where my responsibilities involved one-to-one discussions with students, helping students revising old topics, boosting morale and even conducting my own catch-up lessons for absent students when needed.

I am also a keen musician, my self-taught mission started 7 years ago when I decided to pick up the drums. Since then I’ve been a part of bands, recorded my own music and performed on stage. I was an active member of the music society at university and met many of my friends today through our shared love of music.
