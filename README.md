# About

Senior Lecturer and Course Leader for MSc Data Science at the University of South Wales. KESS2 funded PhD in partnership with TATA Steel, centralized around the application of Artificial Intelligence techniques for predicting machine failure.

In recent times, I've lead on a number of post-graduate and under-graduate modules within the Data Science and Mathematical fields, including:
 • Applied Machine Learning & Deep Learning.
 • Big Data Engineering and its Applications.
 • Programming for Data Analysis.
 • Management Science.
 • Operational Research.
 • Principles of Data Science.
 • Algorithms and Software Tools.

Additionally, I have sucessfully supervised a number of MSc & PgDip Data Science Projects in partnerships with companies across; health care, financial services and manufacturing. 

I am also a keen musician, my self-taught mission started 7 years ago when I decided to pick up the drums. Since then I’ve been a part of bands, recorded my own music and performed on stage. I was an active member of the music society at university and met many of my friends today through our shared love of music.
